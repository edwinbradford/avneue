AV Neue stands for Audio Visual Neue and is a complete theme redesign for the VideoJS Player.

The theme consists of:

01. A complete layout change of the User Interface.

01. SVG icons instead of font icons.

03. Menus that open with button presses instead of button hovers, this is the expected YouTube behavior.
